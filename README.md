# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator
In the following simulator I have implemented FCFS, SRTF and RR algorithms.

Brief explanation of the code:
i) Multiple classes such as Process,Process_creator,Scheduler,Simulator are defined.

  Process class is to initilaize data members such as arrival time, burst time etc.
  
  process_creator for assigning these times to the processes.
  
  scheduler is for ready queue and to maintain and keep in check of the processes.
  
  simulator for simulating the algos.

ii) Functions are defined and used in process creator for the algorithms.

iii) In special case of RR algo time quantum is to be given by the user.
